  content: "Little Lilly has quietly helped families, including yours, stay in touch
    since 2013.\n\nFollowing lean startup ideas we created Lillygram with as little
    techonology as possible to validate our product. We got a smalt, but loyal customer
    base. This suited me fine while taking time for my first born, Lillian. \n\nBut
    now, now it is time to make this baby my priority. We are relaunching in august
    with a system ready for growth and hope you will help us spread the word. \n\nSend
    a friend a link to [Little Lilly](/refer) today!"
