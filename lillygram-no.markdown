- title: Why this change?
  content: "Several things came together this year to force us to take an active stance.
    \n\nShould we stay or should we go?  \nWe decided to stay! \n\nBut in order to
    that we needed to rebrand. Apps connected to Instagram are not allowed \"gram\"
    in their name.\n\nWe also needed to upgrade the system technically. The Instagram
    API we were using retired in June, and the BaaS software powering Lillygram will
    shut down in January."
